The polar bear is white- or yellowish-furred with black skin and a thick layer of fat. It is more slender than the brown bear, with a narrower skull, longer neck and lower shoulder hump. Its teeth are sharper and more adapted to cutting meat. The paws are large and allow the bear to walk on ice and paddle in the water.\\nPolar bears are both terrestrial and pagophilic (ice-living) and are considered marine mammals because of their dependence on marine ecosystems. They prefer the annual sea ice but live on land when the ice melts in the summer. They are mostly carnivorous and specialized for preying on seals, particularly ringed seals. Such prey is typically taken by ambush; the bear may stalk its prey on the ice or in the water, but also will stay at a breathing hole or ice edge to wait for prey to swim by. The bear primarily feeds on the seal's energy-rich blubber. Other prey include walruses, beluga whales and some terrestrial animals.

They have been kept in captivity in zoos and circuses and are prevalent in art, folklore, religion and modern culture.\\n\\n\\n== Naming ==\\nThe polar bear was given its common name by Thomas Pennant in A Synopsis of Quadrupeds (1771). It was known as the \"white bear\" in Europe between the 13th and 18th centuries, as well as \"ice bear\", \"sea bear\" and \"Greenland bear\". The Norse referred to it as isbjørn \\'ice bear\\' and hvitebjørn \\'white bear\\'. The bear is called nanook by the Inuit. The Netsilik cultures additionally have different names for bears based on certain factors, such as sex and age: these include adult males (anguraq), single adult females (tattaq), gestating females (arnaluk), newborns (hagliaqtug), large adolescents (namiaq) and dormant bears (apitiliit). The scientific name Ursus maritimus is Latin for \\'sea bear\\'.\\n\\n\\n== Taxonomy ==\\nCarl Linnaeus classified the polar bear as a type of brown bear (Ursus arctos), labelling it as Ursus maritimus albus-major, arcticus (\\'mostly-white sea bear, arctic\\') in the 1758 edition of his work Systema Naturae. Constantine John Phipps formally described the polar bear as a distinct species, Ursus maritimus in 1774, following his 1773 voyage towards the North Pole. Because of its adaptations to a marine environment, some taxonomists, such as Theodore Knottnerus-Meyer, have placed the polar bear in its own genus, Thalarctos. However Ursus is widely considered to be the valid genus for the species on the basis of the fossil record and the fact that it can breed with the brown bear.\\nDifferent subspecies have been proposed including Ursus maritimus maritimus and U. m. marinus. However, these are not supported, and the polar bear is considered to be monotypic. One possible fossil subspecies, U. m. tyrannus, was posited in'),\n",

Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices release greenhouse gases. These gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight, warming the lower atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, the primary gas driving global warming, has increased in concentration by about 50% since the pre-industrial era to levels not seen for millions of years.\\nClimate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment. Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common. Amplified warming in the Arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost, retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline. Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes. Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct. Even if efforts to minimize future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.\\nClimate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease, and economic loss.

Additional warming will increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points, such as melting all of the Greenland ice sheet. Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming \"well under 2 °C\". However, with pledges made under the Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.8 °C (5.0 °F) by the end of the century.

Scientists used the term inadvertent climate modification to refer to human impacts on the climate at this time. In the 1980s, the terms global warming and climate change became more common, often being used interchangeably.

Merriam was the first to recognize the Kodiak bear as a unique subspecies of the brown bear, and he named it \"Ursus middendorffi\" in honor of the celebrated Baltic naturalist, Dr. A. Th. von Middendorff. Subsequent taxonomic work merged all North American brown bears into a single species (Ursus arctos). \\nGenetic samples from bears on Kodiak have shown that they are most closely related to brown bears on the Alaska Peninsula and Kamchatka, Russia, and all brown bears roughly north of the US. Kodiak bears have been genetically isolated since at least the last ice age (10,000 to 12,000 years ago) and very little genetic diversity exists within the population. Although the current population is healthy, productive, and has shown no overt adverse signs of inbreeding, it may be more susceptible to new diseases or parasites than other, more diverse brown bear populations.\\n\\n\\n=== Color ===\\nHair colors range from pale blonde to orange (typically females or bears from southern parts of the archipelago) to dark brown. Cubs will often retain a white \"natal ring\" around their neck for the first few years of life. The Kodiak bear\\'s color is similar to that of its close relatives, the mainland American Grizzly bear and Eurasian brown bears.\\n\\n\\n=== Size ===\\n\\nWhile there is generally much variation in size between brown bears in different areas, most usually weigh between 115 and 360 kg (254 and 794 lb); the Kodiak bear illustrates island gigantism, commonly reaching sizes of 300 to 600 kg (660 to 1,320 lb). The size range for females (sows) is from 181 to 318 kg (399 to 701 lb), and for males (boars), it is 272 to 635 kg (600 to 1,400 lb). Mature males average 477–534 kg (1,052–1,177 lb) over the course of the year, and can weigh up to 680 kg (1,500 lb) at peak times. Females are typically about 20% smaller and 30% lighter than males, and adult sizes are attained when they are six years old. Bears weigh the least when they emerge from their dens in the spring, and can increase their weight by 20–30% during late summer and autumn. As with ')]"

Here, we quantified local extinction and colonization dynamics of giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) using occurrence data collected by harnessing the labor of >1000 workers and >60,000 worker days for each of the three periods (TP1: 1985-1988, TP2: 1998-2002, and TP3: 2011-2014), and evaluated how these patterns were associated with (1) protected area, (2) local rarity/abundance, and (3) abiotic factors (i.e., climate, land-use, and topography). We documented a decreased rate (from 0.433 during TP1-TP2 to 0.317 during TP2-TP3) of local extinction and a relatively stable rate (from 0.060 during TP1-TP2 to 0.056 during TP2-TP3) of local colonization through time. Furthermore, the occupancy gains have exceeded losses by a ratio of approximately 1.5 to 1, illustrating an expansion of panda's range at a rate of 1408.3\\u2009km/decade. We also found that pandas were more likely to become locally extinct outside of protected areas, when locally rare in surrounding areas, and when certain biotic conditions were not met (e.g., increased forest cover). Local colonization was less likely in areas with high local rarity, challenging biotic conditions and unprotected area status. As the network of panda reserves expanded and the forest matured, the relative importance of other factors such as climate, biotic factors, and land-use became more influential in determining patterns of local extinction and colonization. Our findings provide insights into the factors governing the expansion of panda's range and illustrate how the relative influence of biotic and abiotic factors can change over time, indicating that effective conservation intervention may be able to mitigate some of the negative impacts of climate change and habitat degradation. This insight extends beyond pandas and highlights the role of conservation interventions can play in building resilience under a changing climate.\"),\n",

The fecal microbiome of habitat-housed captive polar bears who had consumed a high protein diet long-term was compared with that of the wild population. Individual differences, season, year and dietary inclusion of a brown seaweed (Fucus spiralis; part of the natural diet of wild polar bears), as a representation for nutritional change, were investigated for their effects on the fecal microbiome of captive polar bears. Microbial variations among fecal samples from wild and captive polar bears were investigated using 16s rRNA gene based metataxonomic profiling. The captive bears exhibited more diverse fecal microbiota than wild bears (p<0.05). The difference was due to significantly increased Firmicutes, Campilobacterota and Fusobacteriota, decreased Actinobacteriota (p<0.05), and absent Bdellovibrionota and Verrucomicrobiota in the captive bears. Compared with other factors, individual variation was the main driver of differences in fecal microbial composition in the captive bears. Seaweed consumption did not alter microbial diversity or composition, but this did not rule out dietary influences on the hosts. This is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, comparing the fecal microbiota of captive and wild polar bears and it reveals distinct differences between the two groups, which could result from many factors, including available food sources and the ratio of dietary macronutrients. Our findings provide preliminary insights into climate-change induced dietary shifts in polar bears related to climate-associated habitat change.')]"
